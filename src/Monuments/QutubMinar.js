                    <p> 
                    Qutub Minar was begun after the Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque. Drawing references from their Ghurid homeland, Qutub-ud-Din Aibak and Shamsu'd-Din Iltutmish constructed a minar (minaret) at the south-eastern corner of the Quwwatu'l-Islam between 1199 and 1503. Kuttull Minor, Delhi. The Qutb Minar, 1805.

                    <p>
                    Built of red and buff sandstone and eloquently carved with inscriptional bands, the Qutb Minar is the tallest masonry tower in India, measuring 72.5 metres high, with projecting balconies for calling all Muadhdhin to prayer. An iron pillar in the courtyard gave the mosque a unique Indian aesthetic.
